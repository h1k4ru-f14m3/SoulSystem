# SoulSystem
## Made By H1k4ru_

This plugin is made exclusively for the Cracked Minecraft Server: Blazing-Realm, which is also co-owned by me. 

## Dependency

MMOItems - 6.7.3 or higher
PlaceholderAPI - 2.11.3 or higher

## How it works

This plugin is like the lifesteal plugin but instead of stealing hearts, players can steal "souls". After losing all souls, you will be turned into spectator mode. Players who are dead which means players that don't have any souls left can still be revived by another player! 

### Note

As if right now, I'm just a starting programmer so there will be a ton of bugs!
